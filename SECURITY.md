# SAP Open Source Security Policy

SAP takes the security of our software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, including our primary [SAP](https://github.com/SAP), [SAP-docs](https://github.com/SAP-docs) organizations as well as [our other GitHub organizations and projects](https://opensource.sap.com).

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any SAP-owned repository, please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via the SAP Trust Center at [https://www.sap.com/about/trust-center/security/incident-management.html](https://www.sap.com/about/trust-center/security/incident-management.html).

If you prefer to submit via email, please send an email to [secure@sap.com](mailto:secure@sap.com). If possible, encrypt your message with our PGP key; please download it from the [SAP Trust Center](https://www.sap.com/dmc/policies/pgp/keyblock.txt).

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  - The repository name or URL
  - Type of issue (buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  - Full paths of the source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  - The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  - Any particular configuration required to reproduce the issue
  - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  - Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Disclosure Guidelines

We like to ask you to follow the [Disclosure Guidelines for SAP Security Advisories](https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/PSR/Disclosure+Guidelines+for+SAP+Security+Advisories).

## SAP Internal Response Process

As an SAP employee, please check our internal open source security response process ([go/oss-security-response](https://go.sap.corp/oss-security-response)) for further details on how to handle security incidents.
