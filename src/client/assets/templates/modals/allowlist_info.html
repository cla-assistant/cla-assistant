        <h4>How does exempting users work?</h4>
        <div>
            If a GitHub username is included in the list to be exempted from signing the CLA, they will not be
            required to sign a CLA. If an organization's username is included, the service checks whether
            the pull request branch is from a repository or fork belonging to that organization: if so,
            then the organization's members are not required to sign a CLA. This exemption does not apply to private
            members, personal forks, or commits authored by non-members. The input is a comma-separated list of GitHub
            organization usernames.
        </div>
        <h4>Why exempt usernames?</h4>
        <div>
            Since there's no way for bot users (such as Dependabot or Greenkeeper) to
            sign a CLA, you may want to accept their contributions without it. You can
            do so by adding their names (in this case
            <i>dependabot-preview[bot]</i> and <i>greenkeeper[bot]</i> separated by a
            comma) to the list of exempting users. You can also use wildcard
            symbol in case you want to exempt all bot users <i>*[bot]</i>.
        </div>
        <h4>Why exempt whole organizations?</h4>
        <div>
            We see at least two use cases you may want to do so:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You develop in a team and commit your changes via feature branches. As
                    soon as you create a new pull request CLA assistant would ask you and
                    your team fellows to sign a CLA even if you are part of the
                    organization and doesn't need to do so. Now if you exempt your
                    own organization all pull requests coming from the same
                    repository will pass the CLA check.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You get contributions from another company which has already signed
                    your corporate CLA. You may want to let CLA assistant accept all PRs
                    coming from this company. Now you can exempt the GitHub
                    organization of this company and all pull requests coming from
                    this GitHub organization (i.e., from that organization's fork) will pass the check.
                    If you want to exempt pull requests from user forks from such a company you should instead use the
                    <i>Organizations whose members are exempt</i> config field below.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
