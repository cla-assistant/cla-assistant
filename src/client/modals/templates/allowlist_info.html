        <h4>How does always allowing users work?</h4>
        <div>
            If a GitHub username is included in the list to be always allowed, they will not be
            required to sign a document. This also applies to organization usernames.
        </div>
        <h4>Why always allowing usernames?</h4>
        <div>
            Since there's no way for bot users (such as Dependabot or Greenkeeper) to
            sign a document, you may want to allow their contributions without it. You can
            do so by adding their names (in this case
            <i>dependabot-preview[bot]</i> and <i>greenkeeper[bot]</i> separated by a
            comma) to the list of always allowed users. You can also use wildcard
            symbol in case you want to allow all bot users <i>*[bot]</i>.
        </div>
        <h4>Why always allow whole organizations?</h4>
        <div>
            We see at least two use cases you may want to do so:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You develop in a team and commit your changes via feature branches. As
                    soon as you create a new pull request CLA assistant would ask you and
                    your team fellows to sign a document even if you are part of the
                    organization and doesn't need to do so. Now if you always allow your
                    own organization name all pull requests coming from the same
                    repository will pass the check.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You get contributions from another company which has already signed
                    your corporate CLA. You may want to let CLA assistant accept all PRs
                    coming from this company. Now you can always allow the GitHub
                    organization name of this company and all pull requests coming from
                    this GitHub organization (i.e., from that organization's fork) will pass the check.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
