# Security Vulnerabilities

The CLA Assistant is built with security and data privacy in mind to ensure your data is safe.

## Reporting

We are grateful for security researchers and users reporting a vulnerability to us, first. To ensure that your request is handled in a timely manner and non-disclosure of vulnerabilities can be assured, please follow the below guideline.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities directly on GitHub. GitHub Issues can be publicly seen and therefore would result in a direct disclosure.**

For reporting a vulnerability, please use the Vulnerability Report Form for Security Researchers on [SAP Trust Center](https://www.sap.com/about/trust-center/security/incident-management.html).
Please address questions about data privacy, security concepts, and other media requests using the Vulnerability Report Form for Security Researchers on SAP Trust Center.



## Disclosure Handling

SAP is committed to timely review and respond to your request. The resolution of code defects will be handled by a dedicated group of security experts and prepared in a private GitHub repository. The project will inform the public about resolved security vulnerabilities via GitHub Security Advisories.
